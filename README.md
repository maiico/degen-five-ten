# Welcome to DegenFiveTen!

This is a Web3 attempt at recreating the famous drinking game known as 5-10, essentially four hands are thrown which the option of having 0 fingers (closed) or 5 fingers (open) randomly - at which point the fingers are summed up - ranging from 0 to 20 fingers potentially.

(Sum of 0) -> all hands closed -> 1/16 odds

(Sum of 5) -> 1 hands open -> 1/4 odds

(Sum of 10) -> 2 hands open -> 1/2 odds

(Sum of 15) -> 3 hands open -> 1/4 odds

(Sum of 20) -> all hands open -> 1/16 odds

Currently things left to implement:

1. Some sort of mobile stylesheet
2. Intergration with phantom wallet
3. Rust development for smart contracts to split profit from 3.5 transaction fee % to nft holders
4. Actually getting the NFT artwork
5. Security / Statistically testing the application before launch
6. Creating a centralized back end sol wallet to payout/ collect payments
